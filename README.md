## Projects ＼(￣▽￣)／

###  Turn-Based RPG (Archived)
Originally made for A-Level Computer Science coursework. Built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming. Learned a lot about:
- Modular design and structuring larger codebases
- Simulating battle logic and turn flow
- Writing code with reusability and testing in mind (＾▽＾;)

> Even though I’ve paused this, I might reuse some of the structure in future CLI tools or games. [View the repo →](https://github.com/doa5/turn-based-rpg-python)
